# stellar-random

This command line program does one thing. It loads a list of your custom empires from the video game Stellaris, and then randomly selects a handful of them and prints them out.

Why might you want to do this? Personally, I use this to artificially increase how often my custom empires spawn in my 
games. I generate a random selection of empires, then turn forced spawning on for all of the selected empires, and turn forced spawning off for all of the others. There might be other uses of this, feel free to shoot me an email if you come up with anything interesting.

## Download

Download the program at the [Releases](https://github.com/Xaeroxe/stellar-random/releases/) page

## Usage

Open the program, then follow the directions given in the console window. At the time this program doesn't support 
command line options. I'll add some if anyone requests them.
